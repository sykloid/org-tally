org-tally
=========

org-tally is a lightweight gamification layer over org-mode's task management
capabilities. It provides functions to add incentives to tasks, tally the
incentives in an org-mode file, and report the results.

org-tally was inspired by org-gamify [fn:org-gamify], but differs in that
org-tally is purely buffer-driven. While this does sound like a regression, it
has the advantage that the tally scoreboard of a given file can be reconstructed
from the file alone, without needing to persist local state. All the tally
information is stored in properties in the org-mode file; if that file is
tracked with source control, it provides a completely auditable game history.
